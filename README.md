# Switch to ChatGPT Tab Extension

It's handy to pin a ChatGPT tab for easy access, but getting to the tab
still involves Control-Tab'ing around or clicking on the tab: not efficient
:cry:.

This Firefox extension allows users to switch to their ChatGPT browser tab
using a keyboard shortcut. By default, the shortcut is set to
"Ctrl+Shift+Y".

## Installation

To use this extension, you will need to load it into Firefox as a temporary
extension for development purposes. Follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`.
3. Click "This Firefox" on the left sidebar.
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..." and select the `manifest.json` file
   from the downloaded directory.

## Usage

Once the extension is loaded, simply press the keyboard shortcut (default
"Ctrl+Shift+Y") to switch to the ChatGPT tab.
