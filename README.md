# Switch to ChatGPT Tab Extension

It's handy to pin a ChatGPT tab for easy access, but getting to the tab
still involves Control-Tab'ing around or clicking on the tab: not efficient
:cry:.

This Firefox extension allows users to switch to their ChatGPT browser tab
using a keyboard shortcut. By default, the shortcut is set to
"Ctrl+Alt+Y".

## Installation

You can install this extension from the Firefox Browser Add-ons store:
